# ASIC Flow Course
# Objective 
> VLSI ASIC design involves creating custom circuits optimized for specific tasks using RTL (Register-Transfer Level) description. This involves designing digital logic using hardware description languages like VHDL or Verilog, converting it to gate-level representation through synthesis, and eventually translating it into a physical layout for fabrication. The process includes architectural design, logic implementation, verification, and testing, resulting in highly efficient and tailored integrated circuits.
