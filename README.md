# ASIC Flow Course Assignments - Guided by Kunal Ghosh
> VLSI (Very Large Scale Integration) ASIC (Application-Specific Integrated Circuit) design is a specialized field of electronic engineering focused on creating custom-designed integrated circuits for specific applications. These circuits are optimized for a particular function or set of functions, making them highly efficient and tailored to the requirements of the targeted device or system.
